 <h1> Rococo </h1>

 <H2> History </H2>
  <P>The Rococo originated in France during the 1720s. It takes its name from the French word 'rocaille', which means rock or broken shell, a shape that is often part of the designs of this art style. The Rococo is also known as the final phase of the Baroque art style. After its creation in France, it expanded to other countries of Europe such as Italy, Austria, Germany, and Russia.
