 <H2> History </H2>
  <P>The Rococo originated in France during the 1720s. It takes its name from the French word 'rocaille', which means rock or broken shell, a shape that is often part of the designs of this art style. The Rococo is also known as the final phase of the Baroque art style. After its creation in France, it expanded to other countries of Europe such as Italy, Austria, Germany, and Russia.</P>
 <h2> Influences </h2>
  <p> The Rococo art style was influeced by The Baroque art style. The Rococo is ofter described as the final expression of the Baroque Movement because it started when baroque artists moved away from symmetry to more fluid designs. The rococo was also influenced by The French court of aristocracy replacing the monarchy after King Louis XIV death when a culture of luxury and excess emerged. Futhermore, the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture played a huge role in the development of the Rococo art movement because not only the church and the monarch were controling the art.
 <h2> Legacy </h2>
